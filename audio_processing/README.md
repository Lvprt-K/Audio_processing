# Audio Processing with Librosa and Matplotlib

This repository showcases basic audio processing techniques using the `Librosa` library in Python along with visualizations using `Matplotlib`.

## Overview

This repository contains Python code demonstrating various audio processing tasks, including loading audio files, visualizing audio signals, computing Fourier transforms, and calculating mean differences between audio signals.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python (3.x recommended)
- Librosa library
- Matplotlib library
- Jupyter Notebook or any Python environment to run the provided code

### Usage

The provided Python script showcases:

- Loading audio files from specified paths using `Librosa`.
- Displaying waveforms and performing Fourier transforms on the audio signals using `Matplotlib` and `NumPy`.
- Calculating the mean difference between consecutive audio files.

Please adjust the file paths in the code to point to your own audio files before running the script.

### Instructions

1. Install the necessary libraries:

    ```bash
    pip install librosa matplotlib numpy
    ```

2. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
    ```

3. Run the provided Python script in your Python environment or Jupyter Notebook.

### Code Structure

- `audio_processing.py`: Python script containing the code snippets for audio processing and visualization.
- `C:/Users/ABC/Desktop/ca audio/`: Directory containing sample audio files.

### Example Outputs

- **Frequency Magnitude Plots**: Visualizations of the magnitude-frequency plots for each loaded audio file.
- **Mean Difference Plot**: A plot illustrating the mean differences between consecutive morning audio files.
